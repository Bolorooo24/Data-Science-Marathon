# Data Science Project Marathon

Welcome to my Data Science Project Marathon! I'm embarking on a journey to learn, practice, and master various data science skills by completing 120 real-world projects. This marathon will not only deepen my knowledge but also help me build a diverse portfolio showcasing my abilities in data science, machine learning, and more.

## Why 120 Projects?

I believe in the power of hands-on learning, and what better way to learn than by doing? With 120 projects, I'll be covering a wide range of topics and challenges, from computer vision and natural language processing to machine learning and web development. By the end of this marathon, I'll have the skills and experience to tackle any data science problem.

## How Will I Organize This Repository?

To keep things organized, I'll be creating a dedicated folder for each project. Inside each project folder, you'll find the following:

1. **Project Overview:** A brief description of the project's goals and objectives.

2. **Code:** The source code for the project, including Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or any other relevant files.

3. **Data:** If applicable, the dataset used for the project. I'll ensure all data is properly credited and sourced.

4. **Documentation:** Any additional documentation or reports related to the project.

5. **Results:** I'll share the results, insights, and visualizations obtained from each project.

6. **Dependencies:** A list of libraries and packages used in the project. I'll provide instructions on how to set up the environment.

## How Can You Follow My Progress?

I'll be actively updating this GitHub repository as I progress through the projects. You can:

- **Watch:** Click the "Watch" button at the top of this repository to receive notifications when I update or complete a new project.

- **Star:** If you find any of my projects interesting or useful, give them a star!

- **Fork:** Feel free to fork this repository and adapt it for your own learning journey.

- **Issues & Feedback:** If you have any feedback, suggestions, or spot any issues in my projects, please don't hesitate to create an issue. Your input is valuable to me.

## Let's Connect

I'm excited to share my progress and connect with fellow data enthusiasts, learners, and professionals. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or via email. I'm open to collaborations, discussions, and learning from each other.

Let's embark on this incredible data science journey together!

Happy coding!
