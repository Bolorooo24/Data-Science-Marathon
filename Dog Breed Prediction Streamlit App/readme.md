Project 2: Dog Breed Prediction Flask App
Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a Flask web application that predicts the breed of a dog based on an uploaded image. The machine learning model behind the app is trained on a dataset of dog images and can accurately classify various dog breeds. Users can upload an image, and the app will provide the predicted breed along with a confidence score.

Code:

The code for this project is available in the "dog-breed-prediction" folder.
Data:

The model is trained on a dataset containing images of different dog breeds. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size.


Dependencies: 
Python Flask
TensorFlow (for deep learning)
Streamlit (for the webinterface)
